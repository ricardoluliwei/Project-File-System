# Build
There are two ways to build it.
## 1. build directly in shell
```bash
gcc FS.c -o FS
```
## 2. build with Makefile
```bash
make all
```

# Run
The executable file name is FS, so you can run it with
```bash
./FS
```
or you can use io redirection to change input/output from console to a file
```bash
./FS < input.txt > output.txt
```

# Presentaion shell
The presentaion shell will not print a prompt, you can enter command directly.
